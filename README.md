CodeFusion is a modern game patching toolkit inspired by CodeWrite, designed to streamline the creation and application of patches for console games. With a user-friendly, up-to-date GUI and extended functionality, CodeFusion goes beyond traditional patch editors by adding support for:

- C code integration: Write and compile game patches in C directly within the tool.
- Symbol support: Reference functions and variables by name with symbol mapping, making reverse engineering and patch creation faster and more intuitive.
- Cross-platform compatibility: Built for modern systems with future-forward standards in mind.
- Familiar workflows: Designed for users of legacy tools like CodeWrite, but with cleaner UX and extended feature sets.

Whether you're a ROM hacker, modder, or reverse engineer, CodeFusion gives you powerful, flexible tools in a modern environment to transform how you interact with games.
